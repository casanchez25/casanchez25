Hi!! My name is Carlos Sánchez, an Electronics and Telecommunication Engineer with experience in Continuous Improvement projects based on Lean 6 Sigma Methodology,  Fire detection and suppression systems, and Data Science. 

You may notice that those branches can differ from others. However, they helped me visualize and understand technical and management information to integrate it with Data Science, getting an integral perspective.

Please check some of my Data Science projects on https://github.com/casanchez25.
